          <h2>I'm here for you.</h2>
          <p class="description">
            I wrote a blog post about the emergence of COVID-19 and how it truly changed everyone. I gave a piece of my mind and advice on how to take some steps to improve your <a href="https://medium.com/@emilymr10/im-here-for-you-cbdffb34e627" target="_blank ">mental health</a> and overall mindset. </p>

          <h2>Talkin Tiktok & Mental Health</h2>
          <p class="description">
            I took some time to talk about the big influence of <a href="https://soundcloud.com/user-119287364/talkin-tiktok-mental-health?utm_source=clipboard&utm_medium=text&utm_campaign=social_sharing" target="_blank" >TikTok</a> on young kids & teens and how the rise of fame of stars like Charli Damelio have proven that social media really can be a negative environment and bring down your mental health. Take a listen and I'm sure you will relate. </p>

          <h2>Getting Fit with Friends</h2>
          <p class="description">
            My friends and I take on the gym together, encouraging one another as it is both mine and my friend Will's first couple of times getting back into working out. My friend Mark explains exercises to us, and I hope they will help you too! Going to the <a href="https://youtu.be/WD5V9Y_tnVI" target="_blank">gym</a> can be intimidating, but with the encouragement and motivation from your friends, you can make it fun! </p>

          <h2>Active Minds</h2>
          <p class="description">
            Active Minds is a mental health awareness organization that promotes education on mental health. Targetting young adults, the hopes of Active Minds is that they will spread <a href="https://www.activeminds.org/" target="_blank" >awareness</a> and change the conversations the younger generations have about mental health. It's very common to push feelings aside and not want to ask for help, but our generation can change that! There are places to donate on this website, so give it a look!</p>
